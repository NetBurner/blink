An example that toggle an LED on a NANO54415 device.

This basic example sets a multi-use pin to GPIO, and then toggles the pin on and off. In this example, an LED is tied to the toggling pin. To use an LED, connect the cathode negative) to P3-1 (ground), and the anode (positive) to P2-15 (Module pin 16)
